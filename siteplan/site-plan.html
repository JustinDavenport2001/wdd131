      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of my site is to help people find reliable, high-quality
        camping spots and enjoyable hiking trails. I want to make it easier for
        outdoor lovers to discover new places, learn what to expect, and plan
        their adventures with confidence.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My audience is hikers and campers between the ages of 20–65 who enjoy
        exploring the outdoors. They value clear information, good
        recommendations, and simple tools that help them choose the best trails
        and campsites for their experience level.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        My site will use JavaScript to make the experience more interactive and
        helpful for users. One dynamic element will be a comment form, where
        visitors can write reviews or notes about camping spots or hiking
        trails. When the form is submitted, JavaScript will validate the input,
        save the comment to an array or localStorage, and display it instantly
        on the page without reloading. Another dynamic feature will be a menu of
        places to go (camping spots or hikes) that can grow over time. Users
        will be able to add new locations to the list using a small form.
        JavaScript will store each new place in an object, push it into an
        array, and render it on the page using DOM manipulation. This will also
        include sorting or filtering options so users can quickly find a spot
        that fits their needs. My JavaScript will use modules, multiple
        functions, conditional checks, event listeners, and array methods like
        forEach, map, and filter to organize and display the data in an
        efficient and user-friendly way.
